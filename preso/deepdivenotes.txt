A look at UI.
A look at using CF remotely.


performance:
0) click vs touch (300 ms)
1) using ajax to load html and dropping it on the page (dont generate the ui on the server)
2) don't wait for the data to display the UI - so show something (like empty ui) and load data into it
3) cache static data (localstorage, websql, file system)
4) cache data even if not static
5) look at your JS framework and check *those* things, jquery for ex has many performance tips related to selectors. must templating languages let you precompile templates. btw, do you need that library?
6) css transitions that use hardware acceleration, basically css best practices


Maybe download my CF->PG app.
